Rotten tomatoes has a page where you can browse all movies. The link for this
page is:
    https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/dvd-streaming-all/

However, this page only shows the first 32 of (as of this writing) 16,001 movies
hosted on the website. Looking through the networks part of inspect elements,
it looks like every time someone clicks show more, a request is sent with the
url:
    https://www.rottentomatoes.com/api/private/v2.0/browse?maxTomato=100&maxPopcorn=100&services=amazon;hbo_go;itunes;netflix_iw;vudu;amazon_prime;fandango_now&certified&sortBy=release&type=dvd-streaming-all&page=2

Where the last integer of the URL is the number of the page. Following this 
request returns a JSON file with 32 further movies, with information such as:
    - title
    - url (relative)
    - tomato score (critic reviews aggregate)
    - popcorn score (fan reviews aggregate)
    - theater release date (no year)
    - dvd release date (no year)
    - runtime (in x h. xx min format)
    - Three main actors
    - mpaa rating
    - synopsis

Presumably, there should be 16,001 / 32 = 500 pages to request, but I've only
been able to get as high as 312. Potentially there are pages where more than 32
are being provided so that will need to be taken into account.

Once we get the movie URL (and potentially some of the information from the 
JSON file). We can visit and collect further:
    - mpaa rating and reason for rating
    - title
    - expanded synopsis
    - tomato score (critic reviews aggregate)
    - popcorn score (fan reviews aggregate)
    - Genre(s)
    - Director(s)
    - Writer(s)
    - Release date (incl. year)
    - Dvd release date (incl. year)
    - box office
    - Runtime in minutes
    - Studio
    - expaned cast

The main differences are:
    - movie URL has expanded synopsis vs. normal synopsis in JSON
    - movie URL has studio, box office, writers, directors
    - JSON has main three actors vs. entire cast in movie URL
    - diff in formatting of runtime (see which we prefer, I think minutes)
    - movie URL has reason for rating
    - movie URL has dates including year

Further questions:
    - Should we collect information from actors and directors pages?
        - highest and lowest rated movies
        - birthday
        - birthplace
        - description
        - list of movies, box office results, year
