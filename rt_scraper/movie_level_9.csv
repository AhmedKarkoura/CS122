For ten years, Senegalese immigrant Samba (Omar Sy - winner of the 2012 César Award for Best Actor) has stayed under the government radar, taking menial kitchen jobs in the hope of becoming a professional chef. Suddenly, as his longtime ambitions for a better life seem just within reach, immigration authorities hit Samba with an order to leave France immediately. Stubbornly holding onto his dream, Samba pins his hopes for a reprieve on a local immigration advocacy center and Alice (Charlotte Gainsbourg), an emotionally vulnerable volunteer with little experience, but plenty of heart. He finds a second home at the center with Alice and her colleagues, including brusque law student Manu (Izïa Higelin), do-gooder Marcelle (Hélène Vincent) and naïve Maggy (Jacqueline Jehanneuf), as they search for a way for him to stay in France. As Samba plunges into the unpredictable world of transient labor, guided by his fun-loving Brazilian buddy Wilson (Tahar Rahim), Alice finds herself deeply moved by his determination. Still trying to put her own life back together after a stress-related breakdown, she takes Samba under her wing, while trying to ignore the growing attraction she feels for him. As the immigrant and the burned-out corporate executive tentatively draw closer, their unlikely cross-cultural connection gives them each the courage to reinvent themselves in this vibrant romantic comedy full of tender humor and heartfelt optimism.

The killers live just down the road, and have been in power ever since the genocide. The family's youngest son, born after the genocide, asks how he can raise his children in a society where survivors are terrorized into silence, and everybody is terrorized into treating the murderers as heroes. In search of answers, he decides to confront each of his brother's killers. The killers still hold power, so these confrontations are dangerous. The killers respond with fear, anger, and naked threats. But he manages these encounters with dignity, asking hard questions about how the killers see what they did, how they live side-by-side with their victims, and how they think their victims see them. Through these confrontations, we feel and understand what it is like to live for decades encircled by powerful neighbors who murdered your children. The Look Of Silence does something virtually without precedent in cinema or in the aftermath of genocide: it documents survivors confronting their relatives' murderers in the absence of any truth and reconciliation process, while the murderers remain in power.(C) Drafthouse|8.8/10|129|124|5|8.9/10|30|28|2|4.2/5|5,419
