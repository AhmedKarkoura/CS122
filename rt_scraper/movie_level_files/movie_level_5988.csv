Filmmaker Roger Nygard, after examining the lives of Star Trek fans and used car salesmen, profiles a number of thinkers both great and ordinary in this documentary. For The Nature of Existence, Nygard prepared a questionnaire with 85 weighty philosophical questions, ranging from ""Why do we exist?"" and ""Do we have free will?"" to ""Who created God?"" and ""Is there a moral yardstick that applies to all cultures?"" Nygard then set out to interview as many people who might have something to say about his list of imponderables as possible, ranging from biologist and author Richard Dawkins, physicist and String Theory creator Leonard Susskind, and Indian spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar to a born-again Christian wrestler, the director of The Empire Strikes Back, a pair of self-proclaimed druids, and a pizza cook.

He became notorious for his graffiti art under the moniker Samo in the late 1970s on the Lower East Side scene, sold his first painting to Deborah Harry for $200, and became best friends with Andy Warhol. Appreciated by both the art cognoscenti and the public, Basquiat was launched into international stardom. However, soon his cult status began to override the art that had made him famous in the first place. Director Tamra Davis pays homage to her friend in this definitive documentary but also delves into Basquiat as an iconoclast. His dense, bebop-influenced neoexpressionist work emerged while minimalist, conceptual art was the fad; as a successful black artist, he was constantly confronted by racism and misconceptions. Much can be gleaned from insider interviews and archival footage, but it is Basquiat's own words and work that powerfully convey the mystique and allure of both the artist and the man. --© Arthouse Films|7.4/10|34|29|5|7.1/10|11|9|2|4/5|740

Gunther Strobbe (Kenneth Vanbaeden) is 13 years old and living with his father, Marcel (Koen De Graeve), his three uncles (Bert Haelvoet, Johan Heldenbergh and Wouter Hendrickx), and his grandmother (Gilda De Bal). You would think that Gunther has more than enough adult role models in his life, but the Strobbes are not an ordinary family; Marcel works part-time as a letter carrier, though the fact there are several bars on his route makes getting the work done a challenge, while his brothers are booze-addled layabouts who sponge off their mother, who is too sweet to deny them her meager pension. Gunther loves his family, but they often seem more like seedy playmates than authority figures, as the men in the house spend their days gulping down beer and sausage, breaking things, playing rude pranks on others, and chasing women, often with hilarious but embarrassing consequences. Years later, Gunther has launched a career as a writer, is married, and is expecting a son; suddenly frightened by the new responsibilities that await him, Gunther seeks out Marcel and his brothers for some advice on fatherhood, a subject one might not imagine is one of their strong suits.

Part music scene and part cultural uprising, black metal rose to worldwide notoriety in the mid-nineties when a rash of suicides, murders, and church burnings accompanied the explosive artistic growth and output of a music scene that would forever redefine what heavy metal is and what it stands for to other musicians, artists and music fans world-wide. The film goes behind the highly sensationalized media reports of ""Satanists running amok in Europe"" to examine the complex and largely misunderstood principles and beliefs that led to this rebellion against both Christianity and modern culture. To capture this on film, directors Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell moved to Norway and lived with the musicians for several years, building relationships that allowed them to create a surprisingly intimate portrait of this violent, but ultimately misunderstood, movement. The result is a poignant, moving story that's as much about the idea that reality is composed of whatever the most people believe, regardless of what's actually true, as it is about a music scene that blazed a path of murder and arson across the northern sky."|5.5/10|23|11|12|4.8/10|8|3|5|3.4/5|896

When asked about his family, Don Mosher tells an interviewer, ""We wouldn't know normal if it fell on us."" The line is more than just a self-depreciating joke as we spend a year with the Moshers, who live in a decaying rural community in New York State. Don is a Vietnam veteran who is still dealing with the emotional scars of war and is either withdrawn or sharply judgmental around his family. His wife, Dottie, tries to put a positive spin on the grim circumstances of her life, but sometimes her desire to nurture those around her causes more problems, including taking in a foster son who turns to a life of crime. Their daughter, Donna, was a reckless youth who became a teenage mother and found herself married to an abusive husband. Donna's daughter Daneal followed the same path as her mother and is now a teenage mother herself, raising a child on her own after the father abandoned her. Donna's younger daughter, Desi, is a clever and intelligent girl who seems unusually aware of the world around her for a child her age. And Don's estranged sister, Denise, has turned her back on the family and instead studies witchcraft with a group of Wiccans who regularly gather in a nearby graveyard. Donal Mosher is a photographer and filmmaker who is a member of the Mosher family, and with their cooperation, he and co-director Michael Palmieri followed them from one October to the next as they struggled with their demons while clinging to family bonds that give them strength. October Country was the grand prize winner at the 2009 Silverdocs Film Festival."|7.3/10|29|26|3|6.9/10|14|11|3|3.3/5|158

Consumed by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge about this mysterious and complex condition, she travels from her home in Iceland to the United States and Europe, meeting scientists and other experts, as well as other families touched by autism. The stakes could not be higher: One in 110 children is diagnosed with autism every year, with boys outnumbering girls four to one. While she holds no unrealistic expectations for her son Keli, Margret worries that he may never be self-sufficient or express himself normally. On her journey, she learns how the brains of autistic children differ from other children and discovers new techniques that could offer a promising future for children with autism, including her son. She also connects with families of autistic children, who share stories of their efforts to help their kids interact with the world around them. Many of their accounts echo her own struggles, including the endless doctor visits and experiments with different treatments, the complication of doing everyday tasks, and the inability to communicate with their children, perhaps the most painful and frustrating aspect of autism. But as she comes across innovative new therapies that might break down the wall of autism, Margret finds hope that her son may be able to communicate on a level she never thought possible. Among the experts and advocates Margret encounters in A MOTHER'S COURAGE: Talking Back to Autism are: Dr. David G. Amaral, research director, MIND (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) Institute; Dr. Simon Baron-Cohen, director, Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge; Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer, Autism Speaks; Dr. Temple Grandin, best-selling author, animal scientist and autism advocate, who was recently the subject of an HBO Films biographical drama; Joseph E.

Edoardo Recchi Sr. (Gabriele Ferzetti) is the aging patriarch of a Milanese clan that has amassed a significant fortune over the years through shrewd investments in the textile business. Edoardo Sr. has a beautiful wife, Allegra (Marisa Berenson), and the two have a reliable and dependable son, Tancredi (Pippo Delbono). Years ago, Tancredi met, fell in love with, and then married a woman named Emma (Tilda Swinton) amid a trip to Russia, and brought her back home to Milan; their children include sons Edoardo Jr. (Flavio Parenti) and Gianluca (Mattia Zaccaro), and artist daughter Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher). The family gathers for a reunion at Edoardo Sr. and Allegra's villa in Milan, but the happy gathering takes a somber turn when Edoardo suddenly dies not long after having lunch with his family. But the death is far from the only pivotal event that occurs that day: Edoardo Jr. also introduces his mother to a chef, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), with whom he plans to open a restaurant, and Emma finds herself drawn to the culinary artist. Meanwhile, Emma learns that Elisabetta is a lesbian, and though initially startled by this news, she takes the liberation of her daughter as inspiration for her own liberation from confining nuptials. On impulse, Emma travels to San Remo, catches sight of Antonio, and finds herself helplessly drawn to him. Meanwhile, as Emma and Elisabetta undertake their life-changing journeys, all of the men in the Recchi clan outside of Edoardo Jr. feel bound to profit-driven motives -- the commercialism of a class that has long ago shucked responsibility for its workers. This critically acclaimed film constituted Swinton's second collaboration with Guadagnino; they first worked together on the 1999 feature The Protagonists.|7.2/10|129|106|23|7.5/10|35|30|5|3.5/5|16,294
