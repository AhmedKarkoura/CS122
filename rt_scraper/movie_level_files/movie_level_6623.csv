Gretchen Finkle (Courtney Davis) is a 17-year-old high school student who has been going through an awkward phase for most of her life. Gretchen has a lamentable fashion sense, she's socially inept, and she has a habit of falling head over heels for the greasiest and most burnt out guys at her school. Gretchen's latest romantic obsession is Ricky, a particularly notorious local hesher, and her mother becomes so concerned about Gretchen's crush that she ships her daughter off to an in-patient emotional therapy clinic to sort out her confused and unstable emotional condition. Gretchen tries to go along with therapy, but decides she needs to set out on a journey of self-discovery if she's going to get to the bottom of her neuroses and her obsession with loser guys in time for the senior prom.

The closest that video-store clerk Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) ever came to fending off monsters was dealing with disgruntled customers irked at the lack of new releases -- but with Halloween fast approaching, that's all about to change. When the spookiest night of the year rolls around and Stan gets stranded in Stormy Night Estates with a group of his best friends, his true destiny is finally revealed. Stan Helsing shares the same bloodline as Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, the very man who once defeated Count Dracula. When Freddy, Jason, Chucky, Pinhead, Michael Myers, and Leatherface come out to play, Stan becomes convinced that he has the knowledge and know-how to defeat the dreaded horror icons. Perhaps with the help of Teddy (Thompson) and the rest of his longtime pals, Stan can uphold the family tradition of battling baddies and pass the torch to the next generation. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi|2.6/10|21|3|18|2.3/10|7|0|7|2.1/5|5,989

Sasha Greenberg (Sam Robards) is an astrophysicist who left the Soviet Union in 1975 to defect to the United States and ended up designing nuclear weapons for the American military. In 1992, after Communism has fallen and the USSR has collapsed, Greenberg returns to Russia for the first time, and while his visit is prompted by an invitation to speak at a conference on physics, he's soon occupied with catching up with the friends he left behind. Greenberg crosses paths with Professor Gross (F. Murray Abraham), his former teacher and intellectual sparring partner, who followed a curiously similar path, turning his back on the United States to design weapons in the Soviet Union. Several of Greenberg's sweethearts also happen to be on hand, including Helen (Ally Sheedy), an astrophysicist from the United States, Natasha (Oksana Stashenko), a fellow scientist from Russia, and Jill (Jicky Schnee), an activist filmmaker.

Karim Chrobog recounts the remarkable story of child soldier-turned-hip-hop star Emmanuel Jal in this documentary tracing the life of the Sudan-born rapper through the good times and the bad. Born in Tonj to a Sudanese Liberation Army soldier and a mother who died when he was just a child, Jal was eventually relocated to Ethiopia and trained as a soldier at the tender age of seven. In 1991, Jal and 400 other children abandoned the army. Only 12 of the children survived the exodus, and Jal was ultimately adopted by a woman working for a children's relief organization known as ""Street Kids."" After being smuggled into Kenya by his new mother, who was married to a rebel leader, Jal began attending school in Nairobi. When his mother died in a car crash in 1993, his friends all chipped in to help Jal continue his education. Twelve years later, the rising hip-hop star would storm the music charts with his hit single ""Gua."" Performing his songs in a unique combination of English, Arabic, and Swahili as well as two native Sudanese languages, Jal frequently sings about such pressing issues as the need for peace in such regions as Sudan -- a nation struggling to regain its balance in the midst of a violent civil war. In addition to being the spokesperson for ""Stop the Use of Child Soldiers,"" Jal also assumed the role of ambassador for the development aid organization Oxfam in 2006."|4.6/10|6|3|3|||||3.9/5|156

The snow is falling and Christmas has come to Chicago. For the Rodriguez family, there is particular cause to celebrate this year; youngest sibling Jesse (Rodriguez) has recently returned home safe and sound after fighting in the war overseas. But as the members of the Rodriguez family converge on their parent's home, there's a strange sense of tension lingering heavy in the cool winter air. Despite the fact that Jesse is doing his best to get back in the good graces of his old flame, she seems reluctant to forgive him for leaving in the first place. Meanwhile, his older sister, Roxanna, has little to show for time spent chasing her Hollywood dreams, and eldest brother Mauricio (Leguizamo) is married to a high-strung executive who seems more interested in advancing her career than starting a family. But while none of this sits too well with concerned mother Anna (Peña), the bombshell she's about to drop could prove the straw that broke this family's back. When Anna announces to her children that she is planning to divorce their father, Eduardo (Molina), Roxanna, Jesse, and Mauricio instinctively pull together and begin to reevaluate their past while looking at the future in a whole new light. Later, as lingering resentments are let go and weakened bonds are reaffirmed, the Rodriquez family begins to experience the healing power of laughter while discovering that together as a family they are far stronger than they ever could be apart. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi|5.7/10|96|50|46|5.7/10|31|17|14|3.1/5|32,335
