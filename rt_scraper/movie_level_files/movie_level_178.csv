771498014|Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes|Alexis Bloom|Documentary|Dec 7, 2018|Dec 7, 2018||NR|107|Magnolia Pictures||DIVIDE AND CONQUER: THE STORY OF ROGER AILES sheds light on the current moment in American political life by following the arc of Roger Ailes: long-time Republican svengali and controversial founder of Fox News. By coaching an unrivaled stable of politicians over the course of fifty years, Ailes heavily influenced Republican politics, steering the conservative movement from Nixon, to the Tea Party, to Trump. Under his tutelage, anger and fear became the coin of the realm, both on the ballot and on national television. Diagnosed with hemophilia at an early age, it took someone intimate with fear to skillfully manipulate the fear of others. With Rupert Murdoch behind him, Roger Ailes started Fox News and turned it into a money-making juggernaut, with profits exceeding those of all its rivals combined. He discarded notions of traditional journalism and turned prime time television into flame-throwing TV. Short skirts and low necklines mesmerized his audience and, as long as Fox made money, there was little oversight of his fiefdom. But the carnival house mirror Ailes put up to America reflected his own distorted personal life. This is a story of serial cruelty, both on the public stage and in private life.

He was no longer the ""Wonder Boy"" flush with success from Citizen Kane, but an aging artist in exile whose luck had run out. ""The Other Side of the Wind"" was the feature film meant to be his Hollywood comeback vehicle.

Missing his ex-wife and on the outs with his troubled 27-year-old son (Thomas Mann), Anders befriends a drug-addicted teen (Charlie Tahan), sending him down a path of reckless and of deeply regrettable behavior. His shameful actions cause him to question who he is as a father and, ultimately, who he is as a person.

The character is a nod to the ghost of another of Desplechin's creations, the brother of Paul Dédalus, three-time hero of ""My Sex Life... or How I Got Into an Argument,"" ""A Christmas Tale"" and ""My Golden Days."" A film within a film--and then some, Desplechin layers narrative upon narrative. With ISMAEL'S GHOSTS, Desplechin returns once more to the past, creating film after film as his way of stepping back in time, and proving yet again that his brand of genius lies in his ability to find light in the darkest of places."|5.5/10|70|37|33|5.9/10|19|12|7|2.3/5|92
