Hoffman is an importer who brings unusual varieties of tea to discerning drinkers in the United States, specializing in teas that have been grown organically and picked and dried by hand by growers who use experience and instinct as their guides. However, the bulk of Hoffman's most prized teas are grown by independent farmers in China, where the growth of industrialization and an increased demand for higher-yield cash crops is helping to put such planters out of business. Filmmakers Les Blank and Gina Leibrecht offer an in-depth portrait of Hoffman and the growers he works with in the documentary All in This Tea, which demonstrates how handcrafted teas are produced and how Hoffman struggles to educate drinkers about the finer points of a beverage that few have experienced in its most sublime form. All in This Tea was screened in competition at the 2007 San Francisco International Film Festival.|7/10|12|10|2|8/10|6|6|0|3.8/5|458

Most westerns of Hollywood's Golden Age presented ""Indians"" as either ruthless savages with no sense of honor or fools who were lost without the help of the white man. (Adding insult to injury, they were usually played by white actors in make up.) However, as issues of Native American rights came to the forefront in the 1960s, more filmmakers stepped forward to offer a more positive and thoughtful portrayal of Aboriginal characters on screen, and Native American performers were given a greater opportunity to present the story of their people in television and the movies. Director Neil Diamond (a member of Canada's Cree community) offers a look at the past, present and future of Native People on the big screen in the documentary Reel Injun, which includes interviews with actors Adam Beach, Graham Greene and Sacheen Littlefeather, filmmakers Chris Eyre and Zacharias Kunuk, and artists and activists John Trudell and Russell Means; Clint Eastwood and Jim Jarmusch also speak about Hollywood's history and their own experiences in presenting Native Americans in their films. Produced in cooperation with the National Film Board of Canada, Real Injun was an official selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"|7/10|16|14|2|6.2/10|6|5|1|3.9/5|1,474

Tension between the two brothers comes to a head when their father is murdered after a crime deal goes sour and Tse-ho lands in jail after being double-crossed. In perhaps the most influential scene in Hong Kong cinema in the 1980s, Mark avenges his friend by staging a dinner table assassination. As Mark tries to shoot his way out of the restaurant, pulling a series of hidden pistols from potted plants and alcoves, he gets horribly injured. With both founding members of the counterfeiting syndicate incapacitated, the operation falls into the hands of Shing (Waise Lee Chi-hung), Tse-ho's former underling who has little of his boss' élan or experience. When Tse-ho gets out of jail, he reunites with his now-crippled comrade, Mark, to take out Shing and to protect Tse-kit whose life is in danger for investigating their former subordinate. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi|7.3/10|14|13|1|||||3.9/5|18,796

Kennedy when he was a Navy lieutenant and Commanding Officer of the illustrious PT 109, a Patrol Torpedo boat stationed in the Solomon Islands. While on patrol one night, a Japanese destroyer rams and slices the 109 in two, killing two crewmen. Having survived the collision, Kennedy searches for survivors, despite suffering from a back injury. Kennedy leads the survivors in swimming to a deserted island, while himself towing a badly-burned crewman. After a few days, the survivors encounter two natives and gives them a carved message on a coconut. The natives take the message to an Australian coastwatcher who arranges for a rescue. ""PT 109"" was the first commercial theatrical film about a sitting United States President released while he was still in office. It came out in June 1963, just five months before Kennedy was assassinated."|5.5/10|11|7|4|||||3.5/5|375

Winner of numerous awards, including Best Feature Documentary at New York's NewFest 2010 and the Cadillac People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival 2009 'The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls' tells the story of the world's only comedic, singing, yodeling lesbian twin sisters, Lynda and Jools Topp, whose political activism and unique brand of entertainment has helped change New Zealand's social landscape. In the process they have become well-loved cultural icons. The film will open in New York at Cinema Village on May 13. Other cities will follow. This is the first time that the irrepressible Kiwi entertainment double act, Jools and Lynda Topp's extraordinary personal story has been told. As well as rarely seen archive footage and home movies, the film features a series of special interviews with some of the Topp's infamous comedy alter-egos including candid chats with the two Kens, Camp Mother and Camp Leader, the Bowling Ladies and the Posh Socialite sisters, Prue and Dilly. The Topp Twins have attained a unique status within New Zealand culture, and their fans range from hard core political activists, to sheep farmers and 'Ladies who Lunch'. Their ability to relate to all kinds of people, and their natural gift for humour, has helped them cross from the fringes to the mainstream. It has often been said that if the story of the Twins was fictional nobody would believe it. From rural backwaters to busking on the streets of Auckland, to performances at the Rugby World Cup and London's West End stage, their appeal is infectious. From support act to Split Enz, Billy Bragg, and Midnight Oil to headlining their own hugely successful tours in Australia, Canada, the USA and Britain. The twins have morphed from radical activists into Kiwi 'national treasures', 'cultural ambassadors', and finally, according to the Glasgow Herald, into New Zealand's 'finest artistic export since lamb cutlets!' 'The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls' follows the girls from their happy childhood on a Waikato dairy farm - where they grew up singing to the cows - to the Territorial Army where they quickly became the Vera Lynns of their battalion. They came of age performing on the streets of Auckland during the heady days of the political protest marches in the early 80s, and quickly joined the forefront of progressive social change campaigning for a Nuclear-Free NZ, Maori Land Rights, a halt to the1981 Springbok Tour, and Homosexual Law Reform. By 1998 only a decade later, Lynda Topp, as Camp Mother, came close to winning the mayoral elections in Auckland, and the Topp Twins were firmly entrenched in the bosom of Kiwi culture with their own prime time TV Series 'Do Not Adjust Your Twinset'. 'The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls' is not just the story of two sisters but also of 50 years of New Zealand history. Half a century of cultural changes and the foundation of a national identity. Part concert film, part biopic, part historical record, part comedy, the Twins share their journey from ""coming out‟ to Jools' recent brush with Breast Cancer with much laughter, honesty and wisdom. It is a film about two truly unique New Zealanders, which ends up saying as much about us as it does about them. 'The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls' is directed by award-winning ex BBC documentary filmmaker, Leanne Pooley. Director of Photography role was shared by Leon Narbey ('Whale Rider'); one of New Zealand's most acclaimed cinematographers, and Wayne Vinten, (Best Cinematography NZ Screen Awards 2008). The film was produced by Arani Cuthbert of Diva Productions, who has also managed the twins for much of their career and produced their popular TV series. -- (C) Argot"|7.1/10|27|24|3|6.5/10|11|9|2|4.3/5|380

Saint Misbehavin' journeys from the hills of California to the Himalayan Mountains to reveal the life of this one of a kind servant to humanity. The film blends Wavy's own words with magical stories from an extraordinary array of fellow travelers both cultural and counter-cultural, revealing the man behind the clown's grin and the fool's clothing. In Saint Misbehavin' Wavy is revealed more than the tie-dyed entertainer and ice-cream flavor namesake that often defines him in the popular imagination. Audiences will come to know the activist, the optimist, and the healer who reaches beyond political, economic, and cultural divisions in his commitment to social change and the alleviation of human suffering. Wavy's life is his message, serving as deeply needed inspiration that we can change the world and have fun doing it. Satirist Paul Krasner describes Wavy as ""The illegitimate son of Harpo Marx and Mother Theresa, conceived one starry night on a spiritual whoopie cushion,"" to which Wavy has replied, ""Some people tell me I'm a saint, I tell them I'm Saint Misbehavin'."" -- (C) Official Site"|6.7/10|15|11|4|6.6/10|6|4|2|4/5|638
