The suit finds its plaintiffs accusing Dole of causing infertility en masse among their population thanks to the use of the DBCP crop pesticide - a chemical banned in the United States four years prior, but still used in Nicaragua after that ban despite Dole's full awareness of the dangers present. The legal battle itself occupies center stage; though the plaintiffs' attorney Duane Miller presents his clients as traumatized, corporately-violated victims, the attorney representing dole paints them as drunks and liars - leading to a heated, highly aggressive courtroom showdown. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi|5.9/10|6|5|1|||||3.3/5|218

So goes the rallying call of Bill Andrews, the American scientist searching for a solution to the great inevitable. A health-conscious runner, his approach contrasts sharply with the methods of his British counterpart Aubrey de Grey, a magnificently bearded, beer-swilling theoretical biologist. The science is fascinating, with complex theories spun out through onscreen animation. And the moral and social implications are certainly meaty. But it is the characters themselves who are the most compelling element of this film. As we spend time with these radical biologists the personal reasons for their quests emerge, with particularly touching scenes detailing their parental relationships. And, like many a high-functioning brainiac, they possess a cadre of peccadilloes, none more so than de Grey, whose views on polyamory and al fresco lovemaking seamlessly flow into a philosophy that both men share - the absolute and defiant desire to live.

The idea is simple, in its way: a stray dog wanders from town to country, and over the course of some seasons observes a married woman and a single man as they meet, love, argue and fight. Or perhaps it's the audience viewing one couple, or two couples, or an alternate version of the same couple. At 83, Godard works as a truly independent filmmaker, unencumbered by all concerns beyond the immediate: to create a work that embodies his own state of being in relation to time, light, color, and cinema itself. The artist's beloved dog Roxy is the de facto ""star"" of this film, which is as impossible to summarize as a poem by Wallace Stevens or a Messiaen quartet. This might be a farewell to words - but it's a warm welcome to the legendary director into the world of 3D, in which it must be seen and experienced to fully appreciate Godard's wondrous use of the technology.

Director Jolie began shooting some of the most dramatic and challenging scenes on Wednesday, October 16, on location far out at sea in Moreton Bay, Australia, with Zamperini (O'Connell) and his fellow airmen-Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock)-having impossibly survived being adrift in the open Pacific for several weeks.

Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's (""Seabiscuit: An American Legend"") enormously popular book, Unbroken brings to the big screen Zamperini's unbelievable and inspiring true story about the resilient power of the human spirit.

When the couples learn that their close mutual friend George is terminally ill, their shared bonds are laid bare and Resnais' exquisitely developed characters begin to grapple with their own mortality and romantic vision of life. The brisk and shrewdly articulate encounters between the characters, played by Sabine Azéma, Hippolyte Girardot, Caroline Silhol, Michel Vuillermoz, Sandrine Kiberlain and André Dussollier, unfold an intimate real life story that bleeds in and out of the theater piece in which they are all cast. Splendid scenes of the English countryside and gorgeously illustrated settings demarcate the turning points in the plot, and the continuously blurred line between fiction and reality. A joyously unsettling meditation on the elasticity of the boundaries of love and affection, LIFE OF RILEY is an entirely unique, ingeniously structured and poignantly jubilant farewell from one of the greatest directors of all time.

Operating without a local government, the lack of community leadership has disastrous effects, including a mass exodus of the white population in the late 1990's. The themes of the film parallel America's growing political divide, underlying racism, and rise of anti-government sentiment. Highlighted in the film is a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case from 1971, spearheaded by then HUD Secretary George Romney, which changed the course of public housing for the nation.

Desperate to gain the respect of his disapproving mother, du Pont begins ""coaching"" a world-class athletic team and, in the process, lures Mark into dangerous habits, breaks his confidence and drives him into a self-destructive spiral. Based on actual events, FOXCATCHER is a gripping and profoundly American story of fragile men who pinned their hopes for love and redemption on a desperate obsession for greatness that was to end in tragedy.

The entire nation, only 40 years old and a few years removed from a second war of independence, is raw. Men, women, and children alike must battle nature and disease to survive in remote log cabins. This is young Abraham Lincoln's world. Spanning three years of the future president's childhood, The Better Angels explores his family, the hardships that shaped him, the tragedy that marked him forever, and the two women who guided him to immortality. Written and directed by A.J. Edwards, The Better Angels delves into visual and narrative poetry to express the Lincolns' world. The stark wilderness they inhabit comes alive in stunning black-and-white cinematography, and the story follows the lyrical course of the characters, who struggle physically and emotionally. They are forced to take on new additions to the family, learning what acceptance and empathy really mean. With an elegant touch and extreme attention to historical accuracy, Edwards shows the austerity of the era and reveals what shaped one of history's most distinctive leaders.

Here they collaborate with the Hermitage Museum to explore the fascinating lives and work of the Kabakovs, a husband-and-wife team who are Russia's most acclaimed visual artists. Born in 1933 in the Ukraine - to a Jewish family during the famine artificially created by Stalin - Ilya Kabakov's life changed when he literally stumbled into the Leningrad School of Art. The deprivation he and his mother suffered during this period serves as the emotional substrata of his art. In the Soviet Union he led a double life: as a successful state-approved illustrator and as a major artist, forbidden to exhibit his own art. Coming to the US in 1988, Ilya began to build three-dimensional spaces using the communal apartment as a metaphor for the intellectual, psychological and physical repression at the core of Soviet life. In 2005, he became the first living Russian artist to exhibit at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. (c) Film Forum|5.5/10|9|7|2||||||49
