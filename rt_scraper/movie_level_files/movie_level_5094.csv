Some Days are Better Than Others is Matt McCormick's poetic, character-driven debut feature-length film that asks why the good times slip by so fast while the difficult times seem so sticky. The film explores ideas of abundance, emptiness, human connection and abandonment while observing an interweaving web of awkward characters who maintain hope by inventing their own forms of communication and self-fulfillment. Katrina (Carrie Brownstein) is a twenty-something reality TV enthusiast, video diarist and animal shelter worker whose world falls apart when she finds that those important to her are often not what she hopes they would be. Eli (James Mercer) is a mid-30s slacker who could offer a thoroughly researched social critique explaining all the reasons why he shouldn't get a job; his experiences temping only reinforce his assertions. Camille (Renee Roman Nose) is a socially handicapped thrift store attendant who spends her days sorting through the donated discards of other people's lives, and Otis (David Wodehouse) is an 84-year-old eccentric filmmaker and inventor who strives to be recognized for his work. Some Days are Better Than Others is about the nuances of communication, the desperation of heartbreak, and the struggle to maintain hope through the passing of time. It's a sad valentine to the forgotten discards of a throwaway society, and a story about knowing when to hold on, and when to let go. -- (C) Official Site"|5.5/10|11|5|6|5.1/10|6|2|4|2.8/5|133

Theresa Russell plays the deeply disappointed Linda Henry, who feels stifled by a strained marriage to Dr. Henry Henry (Christopher Lloyd), who pays more attention to his model railroads than to his wife. Desperate for diversion, she is captivated when Martin (Gary Oldman) arrives, claiming to be the child she gave up for adoption after a teenage pregnancy. She immediately bonds with this stranger, but numerous signs indicate that he may not be what he seems. Strange behavior follows from everyone involved, with some of the film's most bizarre sequences concerning Dr. Henry's toy train fetish. The complex, often ambiguous script is by noted British writer Dennis Potter, who also wrote Pennies from Heaven and The Singing Detective, and Nicolas Roeg provided his predictably stylized, enigmatic direction. Despite several interesting moments, Track 29 is far from either Potter's or Roeg's best work, and most critics found it a bizarre, ineffective muddle. ~ Judd Blaise, Rovi|6.4/10|7|4|3|||||3.2/5|1,388

Before Independent film there was Underground Cinema. And before New York there was...well, New York. Once upon a pre-Facebook time, before creative communities became virtual and viral, cultural movements were firmly grounded in geography. And the undisputed center of American - some would say international - art and film was New York City. In particular, downtown Manhattan in the late 1970's and 80's was the anchor of vanguard filmmaking. BLANK CITY tells the long-overdue tale of the motley crew of renegade filmmakers that emerged from an economically bankrupt and dangerous period of New York History. It's a fascinating look at the way this misfit cinema used the deserted, bombed-out Lower East Side landscapes to craft daring works that would go on to profoundly influence Independent Film today. Unlike the much-celebrated punk music scene, this era's thrilling and confrontational underground film movement has never before been chronicled. Directed by French newcomer C√©line Danhier, BLANK CITY captures the idiosyncratic, explosive energy of the ""No Wave Cinema"" and ""Cinema of Transgression"" movements. Stark and provocative, the films drew name and inspiration from the French New Wave; as well as Film Noir, and the works of Andy Warhol and John Waters. Filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch, Eric Mitchell, Beth B, Charlie Ahear, Lizzie Borden and Amos Poe showcased the city's vibrant grit and bore witness to the rising East Village art and rock scenes and the birth of hip hop. Short, long, color or black-and-white, their stripped-down films portrayed themes of alienation and dissonance with a raw and genuine spirit, at times with deadpan humor blurring the lines between fiction and reality. --(c) Insurgent Media"|6.8/10|39|31|8|7.1/10|19|16|3|3.6/5|590

Yet the Killing Fields of Cambodia remain unexplained. Until now. In ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE the men and women who perpetrated the massacres - from the foot-soldiers who slit throats to the party's ideological leader, Nuon Chea aka Brother Number Two - break a 30-year silence to give testimony never before heard or seen. Unprecedented access from top to bottom of the Khmer Rouge has been achieved through a decade of work by one of Cambodia's best investigative journalists, Thet Sambath. Sambath is on a personal quest: he lost his own family in the Killing Fields. The film is his journey to discover not how but why they died. In doing so, he hears and understands for the first time the real story of his country's tragedy. After years of visits and trust-building, Sambath finally persuades Brother Number Two to admit (again, for the first time) in detail how he and Pol Pot (the two supreme powers in the Khmer Rouge state) decided to kill party members whom they considered 'Enemies of the People'. Sambath's remarkable work goes even one stage further: over the years he befriends a network of killers in the provinces who implemented the kill policy. For the first time, we see how orders created on an abstract political level translate into foul murder in the rice fields and forests of the Cambodian plain. We have repeatedly used the expression 'for the first time'. This is because Sambath's work represents a watershed both in Cambodian historiography and in the country's quest for closure on one of the world's darkest episodes. The United Nations and the Cambodian government have set up a tribunal to try the senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge for international crimes. Brother Number Two's trial is expected to start in 2010. The trials are widely expected to deliver a form of justice but fewer expect the truth finally to come out through this process. Sambath says: ""Some may say no good can come from talking to killers and dwelling on past horror, but I say these people have sacrificed a lot to tell the truth. In daring to confess they have done good, perhaps the only good thing left. They and all the killers like them must be part of the process of reconciliation if my country is to move forward."" -- (C) Official Site"|8.2/10|31|31|0|8/10|9|9|0|4/5|542

FRESH celebrates the food architects who offer a practical vision of a new food paradigm and consumer access to it. Encouraging individuals to take matters into their own hands, FRESH is a guide that empowers people to take an array of actions as energetic as planting urban gardens and creating warm composts from food waste, and as simple as buying locally-grown products and preserving or freezing seasonal produce to eat later in the year. Throughout the film, we encounter the most inspiring people, ideas, and initiatives happening around the country right now. At the Growing Power urban farm in Milwaukee, Will Allen is turning three acres of industrial wasteland into a mecca of nutrition for his neighborhood. In Kansas City, we witness David Ball revitalize his community, turning the modern concept of the Supermarket on its head by stocking his Good Natured Family Farm stores with produce from a cooperative of local farmers. And, we journey to Joel Salatin's farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley to witness his methods for closing the nutrient cycle, allowing cows, chickens, pigs and natural grasses to flourish and produce without ever an ounce of chemical fertilizer or industrial animal feed. FRESH tells the stories of real people, connecting audiences not with facts and figures or apocalyptic policy analysis, but with examples of personal initiative and concrete ways to engage in a new food model. --¬© Specialty Studios/ Ripple Effect Inc.|6.7/10|9|6|3|||||4.1/5|197
