Lluís Homar stars as the former Mateo Blanco, a screenwriter and ex-director who changed his name to Harry Caine after losing his sight in an automobile accident. A past scandal suddenly resurfaces when the news arrives that the producer of one of Harry's old movies (""Girls and Suitcases""), a corrupt stockbroker named Ernesto Martel (José Luis Gómez), has died. For mysterious reasons, this makes Harry's ex-production manager Judit (Blanca Portillo) nervous; then Ernesto's son, Ray X (Rubén Ochandiano), turns up and asks Harry to help him write a vindictive script to get back at his vile father. The film subsequently flashes back to the early '90s, when Martel became involved with his secretary, Lena (Cruz), but Mateo also began to develop feelings for her, and auditioned her for ""Girls and Suitcases."" In response to Mateo's interest in Lena (and her burgeoning interest in him), the jealous Martel commissioned Ray to make a documentary about the making of ""Girls and Suitcases"" as an excuse to spy on the director and star. This enabled him to watch Mateo spiriting off with Lena right under his nose, and set the stage for the wily producer's elaborate revenge against Mateo. As this synopsis suggests, Almodóvar uses a tricky structure laden with flashbacks to both comment on and explain the events of the present; he also interweaves a noirish sensibility throughout the picture that marks something of a first for this director. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi"|7/10|152|123|29|7.7/10|39|36|3|3.7/5|20,503

Swept off the streets as a young boy, Raizo (Korean pop star Rain) is transformed into an unstoppable killing machine by a secret society known as the Ozunu Clan. The Ozunu Clan is so proficient at keeping their existence a secret that most people think they are only a myth, but the moment Ozuno assassins kill Raizo's friend, their days in the shadows are numbered. In the aftermath of that killing, Raizo stages a daring escape, subsequently biding his time until the day he can take the entire Ozunu Clan down. Later, in Berlin, Europol agent Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) discovers a money trail connecting multiple political murders to a mysterious network of elusive assassins from the Far East. While her superior Ryan Maslow (Ben Miles) orders Mika to back down and stop asking questions, she stealthily begins searching through classified agency files on a relentless mission to discover the truth about the murders. Singled out as a target as a direct result of her investigation, Mika is marked for death by lethal Ozunu assassin Takeshi (Rick Yune). Just as Mika is about to be silenced forever, Raizo saves her from certain death. But Raizo knows that Takeshi and the rest of the Ozuno Clan won't stop until he and Mika are both dead. Now, as Raizo and Mika are hunted through the winding streets of Europe, their only hope for survival is to trust one another and stay alive long enough to bring the Ozunu empire crumbling to the ground. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi|4.2/10|114|29|85|4.1/10|28|6|22|3.3/5|189,806

The story takes place in 1986, just as Khomeini is coming into power in Iran. Undercover French journalist Freidoune Sahebjam (Jim Caviezel) is traveling though a small southwestern village when his car breaks down. Surrounded by strife but left with little choice other to wait until his car is repaired, the anxious Freidoune is soon approached by persistent local Zahra (Shohreh Aghdashloo), who convinces him to follow her into the courtyard behind her home. There, she reveals to him that she has just borne witness to a most heinous crime. Just the previous day, Zahra had watched the men or her town stone an innocent woman to death. That woman was Soraya (Mozhan Marnò), long-suffering wife of abusive tyrant Ali. Soraya wed Ali in an arranged marriage, never realizing the horrors that she and her children would endure under her husband's heavy hand. When Ali requested a divorce so that he would be free to marry a 14-year-old girl, Soraya boldly refused, knowing that she and the children would most certainly starve to death without a husband to support them. Ali was too poor to return Soraya's dowry as custom dictates in a divorce, but he found another way out of the marriage. Under Shariah law, adultery is a crime punishable by death if the accused is unable to prove her innocence. Scheming with the newly installed, counterfeit mullah, Ali accused his wife of adultery. In order to ensure that she had no chance of defending herself, he blackmailed several male villagers to testify on his behalf. A tribunal was quickly called, and Soraya's fate forever sealed. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi|6/10|85|50|35|5.7/10|28|14|14|4.1/5|6,654

Frenchwoman Séraphine Louis (Moreau), aka Séraphine de Senlis, lived from 1864 to 1942. Though ostensibly a shepherdess and housekeeper whose chief duties involved cooking, cleaning, and ironing, in her off-hours Séraphine joyously turned to natural elements of the outdoor world, with which she felt a tremendous degree of emotional and spiritual communion. Séraphine channeled these undying passions through painting, and, having only the scantest materials at hand, created paints from elements such as animal blood, oil from church candles, and dirt pulled from the ground. With these crude and raw tools, the nascent, budding artist created tableaux of floral arrangements utterly unlike any seen before. Sadly, those around Séraphine perceived the paintings as coarse and unimpressive -- something of a joke. Her life took a most fantastic turn, then, when Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur), a German art critic, turned up in Senlis -- and laid eyes on the young woman's creations for the first time. Yet, despite the success that Uhde brought to Séraphine, a sad future still lay ahead for the young woman -- one accompanied by continued obscurity and emotional isolation. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi|7.5/10|95|84|11|8/10|32|32|0|3.6/5|15,367

Born near Kiev in 1972, Hutz and his family fled the Ukraine after the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986, and they made their way through Eastern Europe as refugees before coming to America in 1990. After playing with local bands in Vermont, Hutz relocated to New York City in 1997. While working as a DJ at downtown clubs, he began meeting fellow expatriate musicians, and in 1999 Gogol Bordello was formed.

Conroy filters this history through the tragic life of George Freeth - an Irish transplant who turned early 20th century Hawaiian kings onto surfing, and thus resurrected a long-buried pastime that eventually spread to the masses. The film immediately delves into Freeth's tale, then travels around the world charting his influences across numerous cultural boundaries - from Hawaii, to sunny Southern California, to the ""mother country"" of Ireland. The film culminates with the makers' decision to take on-camera rides on colossal, 50-foot waves just off of the Irish coast."|5.4/10|16|9|7|||||3.6/5|101

Billy Paul was a Philadelphia soul artist who could have easily been as big as Marvin Gaye or Curtis Mayfield, but the radical lyrics of his sophomore single proved too polarizing for white America of the 1970s. In the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, amity and personal gain frequently took a backseat to political assertion, especially for African-Americans. Billy Paul had enjoyed international success with the soulful, almost soothing ""Me and Mrs. Jones"", and record executive Kenny Gamble was banking on the fact that America was prepared for the empowering message contained in ""Am I Black Enough for You?"" Not only did that gamble fail to pay off, but effectively crippled Paul's burgeoning career as well. In this documentary, filmmaker Goran Olsson explores how the singer's loving relationship with his longtime wife Blanche gave him the courage to endure even in the darkest of times, and offers an informative look the origins of soul music in the American Civil Rights Movement."|5.5/10|16|9|7||||||

Dark shadows are cast on the Emerald Isle as social problems plague the Irish. The upper classes retain the austerity of the British aristocracy despised by all but the Orange Order, who are loyal to the crown. The church is an ever-present factor in the daily lives of the children, most who attend religious schools. Every subject of concern to the Irish is found in the pubs, a traditional meeting and drinking place for all. Informative commentary gives accurate historical reference to the past and present events that affect the people of Ireland.

Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking ""mule"" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi"|6.3/10|124|93|31|6.6/10|37|29|8|3.1/5|29,151

Previously managed by Clough's bitter rival Don Revie, the Leeds team had just completed its most successful period ever as a football club. It was perceived by many to represent a new aggressive and cynical style of football--an anathema to the principled yet flamboyant Clough, who had achieved astonishing success as manager of Hartlepool and Derby County. He had built these teams in his own vision with trusty lieutenant Peter Taylor. Taking the Leeds job without Taylor by his side and with a changing room full of--what in his mind were still--Don's boys, would lead to an unheralded examination of Clough's belligerence and brilliance over 44 days. This is that story: The story of The Damned United."|7.5/10|136|125|11|7.6/10|34|32|2|3.7/5|56,663

Crisp rose to fame in the UK following the publication of his memoirs and the success of a one-man show, but when a series of typically frank but witty quips during an interview lead to a public scandal, Crisp is approached by an American talent agent, Connie Clausen (Swoosie Kurtz), who says she can get him work in the United States. Crisp relocates to New York City, where he stages a show entitled ""How To Be Happy"" and gains a new audience. However, the high camp of Crisp's persona and his habit of making deliberately provocative statements (such as calling AIDS ""a fad"" and calling homosexuality ""a terrible disease"") earns him the enmity of some gay activists and causes the show to close prematurely. Clausen arranges for Crisp to meet Phillip Steele (Denis O'Hare), the publisher of the Village Voice, and Steele offers Crisp a job as the paper's new film critic. Crisp's witty and acerbic commentary on new movies wins him a new fan base and he and Steele become close friends, but as age and broken relationships begin to take their toll on Crisp, he returns to the stage in a new show created in collaboration with performance artist Penny Arcade (Cynthia Nixon). An Englishman In New York received its world premiere at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival; the film takes its title from a song by Sting, who struck up a friendship with Crisp when they both appeared in the movie The Bride."|6.6/10|9|6|3|||||3.7/5|327
