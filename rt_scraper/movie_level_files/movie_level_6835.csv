The Bloods and Crips are two of South Los Angeles' most notorious African-American gangs. While many outsiders simply cannot understand the decades-long cycle of despair and destruction that has come to define their daily lives, the individuals who comprise each gang are not simply mindless, gun-toting thugs, but real people with real families who have become caught up in a struggle from which the only escape is often death. Beginning with an illuminating look at the genesis of L.A.'s gang culture, Crips and Bloods: Made in America follows the bloody feud that would stretch on for a grueling four decades, revealing the turf wars, hierarchy, family structure, gun culture, and stringent rules through interviews with gangsters past and present, as well as experts, activists, and academics. Throughout the film, the numerous issues blanketing the streets of South L.A. with a deep sense of dread are reflected upon by gang intervention experts, former gang members, writers, and academics in an effort to examine the erosion of identity that helps to perpetrate black self-hatred, prison culture, and the disappearance of the black father in the home.|6.7/10|20|15|5|5.6/10|10|5|5|3.6/5|1,542

Decades after the Korean War has ended, ageing veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M-1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbor (Bee Vang) attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle. Later, due to the pride of the Asian group, the boy is forced to return to Kowalski's house and perform an act of penance. Despite the fact that Kowalski wants nothing to do with the young troublemaker, he realizes that the quickest way out of the situation is to simply cooperate. In an effort to set the teen on the right path in life and toughen him up, the reluctant vet sets him up with an old crony who now works in construction. In the process, Kowalski discovers that the only way to lay his many painful memories to rest is to finally face his own blinding prejudice head-on. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi|7.1/10|230|184|46|6.5/10|51|36|15|4.1/5|332,098

Shortly after then-governor Bush purchased a ranch in Crawford back in 1999, the insular community began to experience an enormous boom. Later, as Bush began his bid for the presidency, he used the town as a means of justifying his folksy, down-home image. But as new shops open on Main Street and the town of Crawford is thrust into the spotlight thanks to the advancing armies of television reporters and flocking tourists, some of the citizens began to feel the adverse effects of Bush's political stagecraft: A progressive-minded teacher and her favorite student are pushed over the edge, the local newspaper is boycotted for endorsing John Kerry, and in 2005 prolific war-protestor draws fills the streets of the small town with over 20,000 anti-war demonstrators. These days, much like the Bush administration itself, the boom has gone bust. As the streets empty out, the small shops board up their windows, the soil settles on two graves, and one person prepares to leave town to start life anew elsewhere, the citizens of Crawford start to wonder what will happen to their beloved town once Bush too beats a hasty retreat in search of more prosperous pastures. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi"|7.7/10|5|5|0|||||3.8/5|237

By the mere act of creating his popular, sample-based songs, Girl Talk has incurred the wrath of copyright lawyers across the world. While some celebrate Girl Talk as a true pop-culture innovator, others condemn him as a 21st Century media outlaw. But reality is never as simple as black and white, as viewers quickly discover through interviews with such cultural critics as Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig, Brazilian Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil, and BoingBoing.net founder Cory Doctorow. As the lines of battle are drawn in the sand, everyone will be forced to choose a side. The world's first ""open source"" documentary, RiP: A remix manifesto was created in part by movie lovers and music fans, who were encouraged to remix raw film footage posted by the director on opensourcemedia.com. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi"|5.1/10|12|5|7|||||3.9/5|328

In the late '50s and '60s, Nancy Spero was on the front lines of the feminist movement. Today she creates art that challenges the polemics of warfare and sexual identity. Pioneering performance artist Marina Abramovic, meanwhile, responds to contemporary cultural issued by using her body as a canvas. Glass, plaster, ceramic, bronze, and paper provide Kiki Smith with the appropriate tools to address philosophical, social, and spiritual aspects of the human body, and Ghada Amer rails against ""institutionalized feminism"" by painting erotic canvases with traditional needle and thread. Lastly, emerging New York artist Swoon creates vibrant street art that amplifies the pulse of urban life. Over the course of the two years in which Our City Dreams was shot, each artist faces triumphs and challenges that give the viewer a tantalizing glimpse into the creative process. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi"|6.1/10|16|12|4|5.9/10|7|5|2|3.7/5|112

Instead of submitting a drawing, however, one little girl scribbles a series of seemingly random numbers on her paper before it is buried. Fifty years later, the time capsule is unearthed for a new generation of students to examine. Young Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) is one of those students. The mysterious sequence of numbers falling into his possession, Caleb takes the paper to his father, Professor John Koestler (Cage), for examination. Studying the numbers, Professor Koestler soon discovers that they aren't random at all, but an encoded message containing the precise dates, death tolls, and coordinates of every major disaster since the time capsule was buried. Not only that, but the document also indicates that there will be three more such events, the last of which indicates a doomsday scenario that appears directly tied to Professor Koestler and Caleb. His desperate plea to authorities falling on deaf ears, Professor Koestler realizes that his only hope for preventing more lives from being lost is to take personal action. Though the author of the prophecies is no longer living, Professor Koestler is eventually able to track down her daughter Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne), and granddaughter Abby, who reluctantly agree to aid in the investigation. As the final date on the list draws near, Professor Koestler enters into a frantic race against time to prevent destruction on a global scale, in the process realizing that in order to save millions of lives, he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi|4.7/10|180|60|120|4.1/10|32|5|27|3.1/5|431,665

Shirley Knight stars as Natalie, a housewife who, unable to cope with being ""trapped"" by impending pregnancy, deserts her husband and takes to the road. Eager to start life over, Natalie attaches herself to hitchhiker Kilgannon (James Caan). She is fully aware that Kilgannon, a former football pro, has incurred so much brain damage that he's practically a child but insists upon sticking with him. Along the way, she has a variety of offbeat experiences with such eccentrics as a snake-farmer (Tom Aldredge) and a widowed traffic-cop (Robert Duvall). An unexpectedly violent turn of events, triggered by the traffic cop's troubled daughter (Marya Zimmet), leaves Natalie virtually back where she started. Director Coppola was still laboring under the influence of the French New Wave in The Rain People; there are so many flashbacks and flashforwards that soon even the actors don't know where they stand. Yes, it's an example of youthful cinematic excess, but there's a streak of genius in The Rain People that is impossible to miss. Coppola based his screenplay on his own short story ""Echoes."""|6.6/10|11|9|2|||||3.5/5|772
