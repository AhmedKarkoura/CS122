Kumiko becomes obsessed with a mysterious, battered VHS tape of a popular film she's mistaken for a documentary, fixating on a scene where a suitcase of stolen cash is buried in the desolate, frozen landscape of North Dakota. Believing this treasure to be real, she leaves behind Tokyo and her beloved rabbit Bunzo to recover it - and finds herself on a dangerous adventure unlike anything she's seen in the movies. With Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter, indie mavericks the Zellner Bros. spin a strangely touching underdog fable, populated by eccentrics and elevated to sonic heights by a Sundance award-winning score from electro-indie outfit The Octopus Project, that will leave audiences rooting for the impossible.

Working out of an industrial building in Williamsburg, her troupe hones dangerous, mind-boggling feats: hybrids of dance, acrobatics, performance art, theater of cruelty, and maybe just plain cruelty. The spiky-haired Streb, outfitted in motorcycle boots and de rigeur black everything, is a surprisingly gamine woman whose charisma is as palpable as the affection and compassion she affords her dancers. Catherine Gund's exhilarating documentary records Streb's latest forays into gravity-defying actions as well as wonderful archival footage that records her early decades of work, leading up to the MacArthur ""genius"" grant she received in 1997. Two of many breathtaking spectacles that punctuate the movie: Streb dancers bungee-jumping off London's Millennium Bridge and dangling fearlessly from the London Eye. Streb earns her reputation as the Evel Knievel of dance."|6.5/10|11|10|1|8.3/10|6|6|0|3.7/5|141

HARD TO BE A GOD began percolating in German's consciousness in the mid-1960s, and would actively consume him for the last 15 years of his life. Happily, he brought the film close enough to completion for his wife and son to apply the finishing touches immediately after his passing. Taking place on the planet Arkanar, which is in the midst of its own Middle Ages, the film focuses on Don Rumata, one of a group of earth scientists who have been sent to Arkanar with the proviso that they must not interfere in the planet's political or historical development. Treated by the planet's natives as a kind of divinity, Don Rumata is both godlike and impotent in the face of its chaos and brutality. (C) Kino Lorber|9.1/10|37|35|2|9.3/10|8|7|1|3.6/5|2,148

Dodson drove to the banks in a black '63 Ford Galaxy LTD. He dressed up like an elegant criminal. He made mix tapes to listen to on his getaways. And in only nine months, Eddie robbed 64 banks - more than anyone has robbed before or since. Taking its aesthetic cues from Eddie Dodson and the unique moment he occupied in L.A.'s countercultural history, director Tristan Patterson has forgone the style of straight‐ahead biopics to create a New Wave dream of a romantic outlaw seeking self‐reinvention and immortality in paradise.
