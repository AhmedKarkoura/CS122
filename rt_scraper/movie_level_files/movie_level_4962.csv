9408|Yellow Submarine|George Dunning|Action & Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Cult Movies, Kids & Family, Musical & Performing Arts, Science Fiction & Fantasy|Nov 13, 1968|Jun 5, 2012||G (nothing objectionable)|87|Independent Pictures|Erich Segal, Al Brodax, Lee Minoff, Jack Mendelsohn|Yellow Submarine is an animated meandering journey filled with puns and dry British humor, where psychedelic music videos take precedent over any linear story. What little there is of a plot, however, concerns a vibrantly colored place called Pepperland that resembles the album cover for Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band come to life. The swirling animation is a mixture of pop-culture images and modern artistic styles brought loosely together with a naïve antiwar message and some clever political commentary. The Blue Meanies take over Pepperland, draining it of all its color and music, firing anti-music missiles, bonking people with green apples, and turning the inhabitants to stone by way of the pointed finger of a giant white glove. As the only survivor, the Lord Admiral escapes in the yellow submarine and goes to London to enlist the help of the Beatles (voiced by actors). The charming and innocent boys travel through strange worlds and meet bizarre characters, including the tagalong Nowhere Man. Several blissed-filled musical sequences and drug references later, the Beatles drive out the Blue Meanies and restore Pepperland to tranquility armed with only music, love, and witty remarks. ~ Andrea LeVasseur, Rovi|7.9/10|59|57|2|7.2/10|11|10|1|3.6/5|47,721

Director Steven Soderbergh, who collaborated with Gray on the film adaptation of his celebrated Gray's Anatomy (1996), has distilled 25 years of rare and revealing footage to construct a riveting final monologue. There are glimpses of Gray's father and of his son Forrest (who provides soaring music for the end credits), but for the most part this is an inspired one-man show, a bittersweet display of the writer-performer's playful and embattled intelligence, his gift for tracking universal truths by looking himself squarely in the eye. ""At the very first meeting I had with Steven to discuss making the film, he said 'I want Spalding to tell the story of Spalding,'"" notes Kathleen Russo, Gray's widow and one of the producers of the film. ""After that, there was no question in my mind about anyone else directing this movie. So I handed him 120 hours of Spalding footage, which became a 90-minute documentary, all told by Spalding through the eyes of Steven Soderbergh. This is a labor of love between the director, the editor, the producers and the family of Spalding Gray-a collaboration whose main goal was to have one more story be told by one of the most unique monologists of our time."" Spalding Gray is most celebrated for his series of 18 monologues, including Sex and Death to the Age 14; Booze, Cars and College Girls; A Personal History of the American Theater; India and After (America); Monster in a Box; Gray's Anatomy; It's a Slippery Slope; Morning, Noon and Night and the Obie Award-winning Swimming to Cambodia. He performed with The Performance Group and The Wooster Group, and on Broadway in plays by Gore Vidal, Thornton Wilde and others. In addition to the film adaptations of his own works-among them Swimming to Cambodia, directed by Jonathan Demme, and Monster in a Box, directed by Nick Broomfield-Gray appeared in more than 40 films, including Roland Joffe's The Killing Fields; David Byrne's True Stories; Soderbergh's King of the Hill and John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon.-- (C) IFC"|7.8/10|32|29|3|7.6/10|12|11|1|3.6/5|1,219
