Back in his day, Johnny Jones (Phil Daniels) and his band The Weapons of Happiness were all the rage. A few decades later, they're just a bunch of old, out-of-work musicians reminiscing about the glory days. Then one day, during a particularly inspired jam session, The Weapons of Happiness crank out a tune that's a surefire hit. Trouble is, every record executive and DJ they approach rejects them as too old and tired to turn out a hit. But that only fuels Johnny's determination to prove his detractors wrong, and when the band recruits a group of fresh young faces as their media proxies, The Weapons of Happiness find themselves in the midst of a unexpected comeback. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi|4.8/10|6|3|3|||||3.1/5|79

Unless the source of this new energy is clean and non-CO2 emitting, the risk of triggering a devastating global climate catastrophe is all but certain.
