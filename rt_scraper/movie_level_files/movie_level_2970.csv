In this witty and incisive follow-up, Winterbottom reunites the pair for a new culinary road trip, retracing the steps of the Romantic poets' grand tour of Italy and indulging in some sparkling banter and impersonation-offs. Rewhetting our palates from the earlier film, the characters enjoy mouthwatering meals in gorgeous settings from Liguria to Capri while riffing on subjects as varied as Batman's vocal register, the artistic merits of ""Jagged Little Pill,"" and, of course, the virtue of sequels. Winterbottom trains his camera to capture the idyllic Italian landscape and the gastronomic treasures being prepared and consumed while keeping the film centered on the crackling chemistry between the two leads. The Trip to Italy effortlessly melds the brilliant comic interplay between Coogan and Brydon into quieter moments of self-reflection, letting audiences into their insightful ruminations on the nuances of friendship and the juggling of family and career. The result is a biting portrait of modern-day masculinity. (c) IFC Films"|7.2/10|123|106|17|7.4/10|38|34|4|3.3/5|9,450

Debunking western myths even more than he did in McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971), Robert Altman's Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) sardonically explores the gap between western history and legend in show biz-obsessed America. Megalomaniac ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody (Paul Newman) assumes the legend created for him by writer Ned Buntline (Burt Lancaster), aided and abetted by his producer (Joel Grey) and his publicist (Kevin McCarthy), perpetuating myths of white triumph over savage ""Injuns"" in his Wild West show, as audiences cheer him on and buy his merchandise. But when Sitting Bull (Frank Kaquitts) joins the troupe with his interpreter (Will Sampson), his request for authenticity threatens to throw a wrench into the proceedings. Regardless of how Bill may feel about the facts, he must bow to the preferences of the paying public. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi"|6.5/10|12|10|2|||||3.2/5|2,103

For filmmaker Nina Davenport, that old playground song didn't go as planned. Single at age forty-one, she decides to have a baby on her own, never minding the odds stacked against her or the extra hurdles of living in New York City. Filming the whole process, she excels at candour and comedy. Think of a real-life Girls, only with more grown-up problems. Nina has spent over a decade turning her life experiences into cinematic essays, following the path of her mentors, documentarian Ross McElwee (Sherman's March) and Robb Moss (The Same River Twice). Her combined talents as a cinematographer, editor, and storyteller set her apart from the average first-person filmmaker. She develops characters and story arcs better than most Hollywood screenwriters do. In her quest for motherhood, Nina enlists her best friend Amy as a birth partner and her gay friend Eric as a sperm donor. While pregnant, Nina winds up dating the film critic John Anderson in an unusual display of sympathy between a director and a reviewer. The process of baby-making affects all their lives profoundly. Additionally, Nina struggles to cope with the recent death of her mother, who had been a source of strength, and seeks to improve relations with her father, a source of discouragement. The film taps into the zeitgeist topic of how the modern family is being re-imagined in the early twenty-first century. They say it takes a village to raise a child. In Nina's case, that village is populated by urban sophisticates who have delayed procreation for as long as possible and are late in confronting its joys and chores. Nina is unflinching at exposing her inner and outer self as a case study. She's refreshingly frank and funny about the trials that women endure in order to get pregnant, give birth and manage the early years of parenting. After watching, you'll want to thank your mother.

Previously pampered, the twins must learn how to survive alone in their new, rural surroundings. They realize that the only way to cope with the absurd and inhumane world of adults and war is to become completely unfeeling and merciless. By learning to free themselves from hunger, pain and emotion, they will be able to endure future hardships. So they begin their own series of studies: they fortify their spirits by reading the Bible and learning foreign languages. They practice every day to harden their bodies and minds. They hold their hands over flames, cut their legs, arms and chests with a knife and pour alcohol right on their wounds.

Altina is an affecting, provocative, and richly informative documentary about an American trendsetter-a woman before her time. Free of academic constraints and confident in her keen intellect, she crafted fragments of her life into sculptures that defined her surreal and original world.

Applying his deconstructive eye to the ""film noir"" tradition, Robert Altman updated Raymond Chandler in his 1973 version of Chandler's novel, The Long Goodbye. Smart-aleck, cat-loving private eye Philip Marlowe (Elliott Gould) is certain that his friend Terry Lennox (Jim Bouton) isn't a wife-killer, even after the cops throw Marlowe in jail for not cooperating with their investigation into Lennox's subsequent disappearance. Once he gets out of jail, Marlowe starts to conduct his own search when he discovers that mysterious blonde Eileen Wade (Nina Van Pallandt), who hired him to find her alcoholic novelist husband Roger (Sterling Hayden), lives on the same Malibu street as the absent Lennox and his deceased spouse. As numerous variations on the title song play in unexpected places, Marlowe encounters a shady doctor (Henry Gibson), a bottle-wielding gangster (director Mark Rydell), and a guard aping Barbara Stanwyck (among other stars), before heading to Mexico to stumble onto the truth once and for all. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi"|8.4/10|31|30|1|||||4/5|10,229

In candid interviews, the Pulitzer Prize-winner discusses his distinctly unliterary upbringing in Newark, NJ, his admiration for Saul Bellow and Bernard Malamud, his ""brutal and lurid"" first marriage, and how Zuckerman may or may not be his alter-ego. Nathan Englander, Mia Farrow, Jonathan Franzen, and Martin Garbus are among those who talk about the man and his writing.

771239201|Ornette: Made in America|Shirley Clarke|Documentary|Aug 31, 2012|Nov 11, 2014||NR|80|Milestone Pictures||"Few intersections are as potentially thrilling and explosive as the meeting of great artists from different disciplines. When Oscar (R)-winning filmmaker (and former dancer) Shirley Clarke trained her cameras and creativity on jazz great Ornette Coleman, the result was a documentary portrait like no other - kaleidoscopic, mesmerizing and well, cosmic. This meeting of extraordinary New York talents originated in Forth Worth in the early 1980s. Producer Kathelin Hoffman was preparing to open Caravan of Dreams, an innovative new cultural center, and invited native son Coleman to write a jazz piece to perform with his band Prime Time for the opening. Hoffman then set out to find a director to document the performance. Speaking with Coleman, she learned that Clarke had started a film about him back in the 1960s. So Hoffman visited the filmmaker at New York's Chelsea Hotel and the trio embarked on a three-year project that would stretch the conventions of the documentary genre in almost every way possible. The team confronted a number of technical challenges that provoked innovation. In order to end up with a 35mm projection print, Clarke and Hoffman had to invent editing techniques to handle footage shot in a wide variety of film and video media. Since she had filmed the original footage, Clarke had become a leading innovator in experimental and documentary video production. The pair decided to try out a new Super 16 film stock and hired young cinematographer Ed Lachman, based on his brilliant Super 16 work on Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract. The structure of the documentary required creativity and collaboration. While Coleman and Hoffman were focused on making a film about the creative process, Clarke wanted to continue the film she had begun years earlier about the musician and his relationship with his talented son, Denardo. The team also hoped the film could tell the story of a poor black kid returning home as a famed composer. And to make things even more challenging, Coleman decided to create a nightclub performance, a symphony, and a chamber music piece to celebrate his Fort Worth homecoming. The documentary uses the score of Coleman's symphony ""Skies of America"" as an underlying script and, like his avant-garde jazz, exploits non-linear means of storytelling to bring everything together. Dazzling sound and visual editing weave together archival shots from 16mm and video; dream and flashback sequences; animation; the theories of Buckminster Fuller; North African influences on 1960s luminaries (including William Burroughs, Tennessee Williams, Paul Bowles and Allen Ginsberg); a music video; and Coleman's musings on the intellectual and experiential basis for Southern jazz and blues. And all are syncopated to Coleman's ""harmolodic"" score, which music critic Thom Jurek described as ""dangerous and rewarding music."" ORNETTE: MADE IN AMERICA opened in 1986 to a wave of enthusiastic reviews. David Sterritt in the Christian Science Monitor called it ""a quirky cinematic spree that unfolds the saga of Coleman's career while visually evoking the boundless 'free jazz' flights of his unpredictable music."" Don Snowden of the the Los Angeles Times wrote: ""Clarke's use of rapid-fire editing, the juxtaposition of images and its non-linear story line gives the film a far more sweeping scope than a standard portrait of an artist."" But sadly, Clarke soon afterwards developed Alzheimer's and in the years following her death in 1997, the documentary was rarely shown. In 2011, Milestone and producer Kathelin Hoffman Gray brought the original elements to the UCLA Film & Television Archive to oversee a restoration of ORNETTE: MADE IN AMERICA. With the active participation of Hoffman Gray, cinematographer Lachman and Milestone's VP Dennis Doros, UCLA restorationist Ross Lipman (Killer of Sheep, The Exiles, Wanda) painstakingly color corrected each scene of the collage-like film. Then Lipman and Audio Mechanic's John Polito restored the soundtrack to insure that the sound quality matched the film's splendor."|7/10|19|17|2|7.3/10|10|9|1|3.5/5|97

Coming of age in the 1960s, John Wojtowicz took pride in being a pervert. His libido was excessive even by the libertine standards of the era, with multiple wives and lovers, both women and men. In August, 1972, he attempted to rob a Brooklyn bank to finance his lover's sex reassignment surgery. The attempted heist resulted in a fourteen-hour hostage situation that was broadcast on TV. Three years later, Pacino portrayed his character instigating the unforgettable crime on the big screen. The award-winning film had a profound influence on Wojtowicz, and when he emerged from prison six years later, he became known as ""The Dog."" Filmed over the course of a ten-year period by co-directors Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren, and interweaving extraordinary archival footage on the robbery, 70s era interviews and the early gay liberation movement in which ""The Dog"" played an active role, the documentary captures the many sides of John Wojtowicz's larger- than-life persona: he is by turns lover, husband, soldier, lover, activist, New Yorker, mama's boy and bank robber.

Moving with her mother to the remote Japanese island of Shio, Momo soon discovers three yokai living in her attic, a trio of mischievous spirit creatures that only she can see and who create mayhem in the tiny seaside community as she tries desperately to keep them hidden.

Set against the backdrop of WWII, The Last Sentence is based on the life of crusading journalist Torgny Segerstedt, editor-in-chief of one of Sweden's leading newspapers, highlighting his one-man battle against Nazism and his country's policy of appeasement to Hitler. With Sweden caught between Nazi Germany and Stalin's Russia, the country's elites chose a policy of neutrality and compliance, with few daring to speak up against the evil around them. Among those who did, nobody was as loud and as uncompromising as Segerstedt (Danish star Jesper Christensen, Nymphomaniac: Volume 1, Melancholia), one of the most prominent Swedish journalists of the 20th century. In the eyes of many of his countrymen, his pen was far more dangerous than the Nazi sword. Amidst the political turmoil of the era, Segerstedt's own personal life took a dramatic and scandalous turn as he entered into a very public affair with Maja Forssman, the Jewish wife of his close friend, the newspaper's publisher. Maja Forssman is played by Pernilla August, winner of the Cannes Best Actress Award for Bille August's Best Intentions. (c) Music Box|7/10|29|22|7|7.6/10|15|11|4|3.1/5|277

Alone in a Paris theater after a long day of auditioning actresses for his new play, writer-director Thomas (Amalric) complains that no actress he's seen has what it takes to play the lead female character: a woman who enters into an agreement with her male counterpart to dominate him as her slave. Thomas is about to leave the theater when actress Vanda (Seigner) bursts in, a whirlwind of erratic - and, it turns out, erotic - energy. At first she seems to embody everything Thomas has been lamenting. She is pushy, foul-mouthed, desperate and ill-prepared - or so it seems. When Thomas finally, reluctantly, agrees to let her try out for the part, he is stunned and captivated by her transformation. Not only is Vanda a perfect fit (even sharing the character's name), but she apparently has researched the role exhaustively, learned her lines by heart and even bought her own props. The likeness proves to be much more than skin-deep. As the extended ""audition"" builds momentum, Thomas moves from attraction to obsession until, with Vanda taking an ever more dominant role, the balance of power shifts completely.
