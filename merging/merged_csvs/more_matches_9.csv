After entering a local watering hole and relaying a series of elaborate but entirely fabricated tales, a prostitute posing as an advertising executive, a piano tuner claiming to be a genetic engineer, and a butcher posing as a Kremlin insider all go their separate ways. In the hours following their strange conversation, all three will experience a surreal and richly symbolic voyage into a land where the specter of even the most elaborate of lies can somehow fade into reality for one tantalizing instant. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",6.4/10,27.0,20.0,7.0,6.2/10,13.0,10.0,3.0,3.4/5,834,4,2006

Bogdan (Dragos Bucur) is a guy in his early thirties who is married to Smaranda (Anamaria Marinca); they have a four-year-old son, Adrian (Vlad Muntean), and another baby is on the way. While Bogdan loves his wife and is doing well running a furniture company, sometimes he thinks about his carefree younger days and wonders if he's made the right choices in life. Bogdan, Smaranda and Adrian head off to a seaside resort for a few days of vacation; Bogdan and Smaranda have a spat and he wanders off into town, where to his surprise he happens upon Sorin (Mimi Branescu) and Vali (Adrian Vancica), two friends from his high school days. Sorin and Vali invite ""Boogie,"" as Bogdan was nicknamed back in the day, to join them for an evening of carousing, and as they hit the town for an evening of boozing and chasing local streetwalker Ramona (Roxana Iancu), Bogdan notices that while he's grown a lot over the years, his buddies have hardly changed a bit since they were teenagers, allowing him to see what his life could have been without marriage, parenthood and responsibility weighing him down. Boogie was screened as part of the Directors' Fortnight series at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",6.7/10,10.0,10.0,0.0,,,,,3.4/5,353,Boogie,2008

As Jack begins spiraling into a self-destructive cycle of whisky and reckless behavior, his best friends Ozzy, Scotch, and Kate struggle to find a means of jarring their depressed pal back to reality. Strangely enough, it isn't Jack's grown-up friends who offer him the most useful relationship advice, but his 11-year-old neighbor, Sophie, whose unusually wise and thoughtful words have a special way of helping the self-absorbed urbanite shake off the nostalgia and excess that threaten to consume him.",3.9/10,7.0,2.0,5.0,,,,,3.1/5,"2,123",Frost,2009

A success with critics and audiences alike at the Toronto and Seattle film festivals, this elegantly told tale of intrigue is not to be missed. Kristin Scott Thomas is Suzanne, the bourgeois wife of a successful doctor, Samuel (Yvan Attal), living together with their children in the south of France. Weighted down by a thrill-less lifestyle and a stale marriage, Suzanne falls for the handsome young Ivan (Sergi López), an immigrant ex-con working on their property. Their affair is passionate, but Suzanne is wracked by guilt. When she confesses to her husband, his retaliation begins an ugly turn of events. -- (C) IFC",6.2/10,65.0,44.0,21.0,6.3/10,21.0,12.0,9.0,3.1/5,"13,754",Leaving,2010

For more than a decade now he has been quietly but consistently turning out a series of films that are somehow both self-effacing and bold, behavioral and formally experimental, including masterpieces such as VIRGIN STRIPPED BARE BY HER BACHELORS, TURNING GATE, and TALE OF CINEMA. His most recent film to hit North American shores (the feverishly prolific Hong has already lapped us, with an even newer film - LIKE YOU KNOW IT ALL - premiering at Cannes last May) finds him experimenting with a change of scene - set in Paris rather than Korea, NIGHT AND DAY adds the element of cultural confusion to his usual thematic arsenal. After getting busted for smoking pot with some students, 40-year-old artist Seong-nam impulsively flees to Paris, leaving his wife behind, and finds himself living in a kind of limbo. Staying in a run-down hotel inhabited mostly by fellow Korean ex-pats, Seong-nam wanders aimlessly around the city, becoming ensnared by temptation in the form of both an ex-flame, and a couple of young art students. Leisurely, episodic, sharp, and deeply funny, NIGHT AND DAY finds Hong working at the height of his powers. -- (C) Anthology",7.2/10,13.0,12.0,1.0,,,,,3.6/5,334,Night and Day,2009
