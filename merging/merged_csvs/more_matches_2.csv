As cox and oarsman, they have helped their team win several rowing cups in the past and are now looking forward to the big regatta in the countryside. But, this trip is no summer camp and the first problems soon arise. As Achim's relationship with his girlfriend grows more serious, Tobi starts to realize that his feelings for Achim run deeper than he's willing to admit to himself. He feels confused, unsure of himself and increasingly left out. When the much-anticipated Berlin girls' team is being replaced by a team of athletic, clich√©-busting young gay men, Tobi and his teammates are suddenly forced to grapple with their prejudices, their fears, and, perhaps, their hidden longings. As the tension grows, Tobi, Achim and the others head toward a confrontation as fierce and ultimately as liberating as the summer storm gathering over the lake.",5.6/10,31.0,15.0,16.0,5.7/10,16.0,9.0,7.0,3.7/5,"6,910",Summer Storm,Marco Kreupainter,Marco Kreuzpaintner,
